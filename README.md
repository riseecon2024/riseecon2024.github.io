# Oil and Gas Wells, Facilities financed by Royal Bank of Canada
Royal Bank of Canada and its subsidiary City National Bank have provided nearly $68 billion in financing to 8 companies that are among the largest greenhouse gas emitters, oil and gas well operators, and refinery owners in the state. City National Bank is also one of the worst redlining banks in the state. While there are existing campaigns against the top four largest banks, Rise Economy is focusing on a mid-sized bank which is also terrible on fossil fuel financing as we may have more bargaining power with a smaller sized bank. We intend to meet with the banks in September, where we will present a set of demands in hopes of reaching a Community Benefits Agreement.

Below is a map of the oil and gas wells and facilities the bank finances.

RBC provided $2.376 Billion to California Resources Corporation, which owns 11.7% of all oil wells in California. Of California Resource Corporation’s 24,742 oil wells, 64% are in BIPOC neighborhoods. Twenty-four percent are in low to moderate income neighborhoods. The majority of which (16,205) are in the Bakersfield area. Sixty-eight percent, or 8,598, of wells in Bakersfield are active or idle, and the majority of these active or idle wells (72%) are in Bakersfield’s BIPOC neighborhoods. Of particular concern is that 89% of RBC-funded California Resource Corporation’s new wells in Bakersfield are located in BIPOC neighborhoods. Seventy percent of all new wells in the state were in BIPOC neighborhoods.

RBC also finances companies that operate 63 refineries, resulting in 33.4 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 alone – accounting for over a third of all GHG emissions from large facilities reported to the EPA. These companies include:
 - Calpine Corp, which owns 14 refinery sites in the state
 - Marathon Petroleum, which owns the Los Angeles refinery and part of the Martinez refinery
 - PBF Energy, which owns the Martinez refinery and Torrance refinery
 - Phillips 66 which owns the Wilmington refinery, where nearby residents have the sixth-lowest life expectancy out of Los Angeles’ communities. The refinery has been found to contribute to about 87% of the city’s excess cancer risk
 - Sempra, a high emitting utilities company
 - Valero Energy Corp, which owns the Benicia refinery – which was recently issued a $1.75 million fine for safety violations in connection with the death of a contract worker at the refinery –  and
 - Shell PLC, which was a former owner of a statewide well operator and named in a lawsuit brought by the California Attorney General alleging deceptive marketing and liability for harms caused by climate change.

Refineries like the Martinez refinery subject its local residents to pollution of toxic metals and large fires releasing more than 200,000 pounds of renewable diesel fuel and smoke that led to a multi-agency investigation and major penalty from Bay Area air regulators. 

# DEMANDS. We want Royal Bank of Canada and City National Bank to commit to a Community Benefits Agreement that does the following:

<strong>Stop funding fossil fuels</strong>

 - Create a plan and timeline for phase-outs of financing of the dirtiest fossil fuels. Work towards an end of financing of all new fossil fuel extraction activities.

<strong>Repair the harm caused by fossil fuel financing:</strong>

 - Respect Indigenous rights and BIPOC communities (known as Free, Prior and Informed Consent) in all fossil fuel financing decisions.
 - Ensure that oil and gas well operators have plugged or have plans for plugging all idle wells, and provide financing if necessary, for plugging and remediation of the oil well fields.
 - Support small businesses across the state seeking to transition their operations to cleaner operations.
 - Support efforts to transition local workforces dependent on declining industries to good jobs in green economies, technologies, and sectors.
 - Ensure borrowers have adequate transition plans that are not greenwashing.

<strong>Repair the harm caused by discriminatory banking practices:</strong>

 - Invest in municipalities’ community development activities, where cities rely on revenue from fossil fuel companies to fund community development.
 - Promote homeownership and small business ownership for BIPOC households in California.
 - Ensure no redlining throughout our state; address redlining concerns in all regions of California.
 - Develop policies to ensure that RBC, CNB, and their clients do not engage in bluelining - denying credit or charging more to BIPOC households based on perceptions of a neighborhood's vulnerability to climate change impacts.
